# Dogpark messagenger
A small program to solve the problem of the 20 person limit for a group text, while still using SMS 
as the method of communication, so user's will not have to install any new app to use the program.
User's will text the program, which will then publish the message to the other user's.
Support for commands that are between the user and program only.

Uses gmail API to send and receive text messages.
